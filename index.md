<div style="text-align: justify">
  An analysis of whether proximity of the HDB to the expressway has a relationship with HDB resale prices. Statistical analysis found that the mean HDB resale prices were lower for HDBs near expressway compared to HDBs not near expressway, for 2-room, 3-room, 4-room, 5-room and executive HDBs.

<div style="text-align: justify">
  A case study in Hong Kong to understand the efficacy of different classifier methods on detecting landslide susceptibility based on terrain information. To address the issue of imbalanced data, synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was applied to expand the quantity of landslide samples. Results indicated that across all models, the usage of balanced data have led to improved outcomes, with recursive partitioning approaches like Bootstrap Forest and Boosted Tree generally performed better compared to logistic regression.
